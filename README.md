# HSS-Tool-Life-Prediction-Using-XGBoost-ML-Project
Determined how cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut parameters affect the ability to forecast tool life in milling operations using Xgboost Regressor.In this experiment Taguchi DOE was used for performing machining operations.The Xgboost Regressor model predicts excellent tool life with train accuracy of 99.9% and test accuracy of 98.0%
